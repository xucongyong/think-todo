# Federation Architecture

> **Status: Design spec - not yet implemented**

> Multi-workspace coordination for Gas Town and Beads

## Overview

Federation enables multiple Gas Town instances to reference each other's work,
coordinate across organizations, and track distributed projects.

## Why Federation?

Real enterprise projects don't live in a single repo:

- **Microservices:** 50 repos, tight dependencies, coordinated releases
- **Platform teams:** Shared libraries used by dozens of downstream projects
- **Contractors:** External teams working on components you need to track
- **Acquisitions:** New codebases that need to integrate with existing work

Traditional tools force you to choose: unified tracking (monorepo) or team
autonomy (multi-repo with fragmented visibility). Federation provides both:
each workspace is autonomous, but cross-workspace references are first-class.

## Entity Model

### Three Levels

```
Level 1: Entity    - Person or organization (flat namespace)
Level 2: Chain     - Workspace/town per entity
Level 3: Work Unit - Issues, tasks, molecules on chains
```

### URI Scheme

Full work unit reference (HOP protocol):

```
hop://entity/chain/rig/issue-id
hop://steve@example.com/main-town/greenplace/gp-xyz
```

Cross-repo reference (same platform):

```
beads://platform/org/repo/issue-id
beads://github/acme/backend/ac-123
```

Within a workspace, short forms are preferred:

```
gp-xyz             # Local (prefix routes via routes.jsonl)
greenplace/gp-xyz  # Different rig, same chain
./gp-xyz           # Explicit current-rig ref
```

See `~/gt/docs/hop/GRAPH-ARCHITECTURE.md` for full URI specification.

## Relationship Types

### Employment

Track which entities belong to organizations:

```json
{
  "type": "employment",
  "entity": "alice@example.com",
  "organization": "acme.com"
}
```

### Cross-Reference

Reference work in another workspace:

```json
{
  "references": [
    {
      "type": "depends_on",
      "target": "hop://other-entity/chain/rig/issue-id"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Delegation

Distribute work across workspaces:

```json
{
  "type": "delegation",
  "parent": "hop://acme.com/projects/proj-123",
  "child": "hop://alice@example.com/town/greenplace/gp-xyz",
  "terms": { "portion": "backend", "deadline": "2025-02-01" }
}
```

## Agent Provenance

Every agent operation is attributed. See [identity.md](../concepts/identity.md) for the
complete BD_ACTOR format convention.

### Git Commits

```bash
# Set per agent session
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="greenplace/crew/joe"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="steve@example.com"  # Workspace owner
```

Result: `abc123 Fix bug (greenplace/crew/joe <steve@example.com>)`

### Beads Operations

```bash
BD_ACTOR="greenplace/crew/joe"  # Set in agent environment
bd create --title="Task"        # Actor auto-populated
```

### Event Logging

All events include actor:

```json
{
  "ts": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "type": "sling",
  "actor": "greenplace/crew/joe",
  "payload": { "bead": "gp-xyz", "target": "greenplace/polecats/Toast" }
}
```

## Discovery

### Workspace Metadata

Each workspace has identity metadata:

```json
// ~/gt/.town.json
{
  "owner": "steve@example.com",
  "name": "main-town",
  "public_name": "steve-greenplace"
}
```

### Remote Registration

```bash
gt remote add acme hop://acme.com/engineering
gt remote list
```

### Cross-Workspace Queries

```bash
bd show hop://acme.com/eng/ac-123    # Fetch remote issue
bd list --remote=acme                # List remote issues
```

## Aggregation

Query across relationships without hierarchy:

```bash
# All work by org members
bd list --org=acme.com

# All work on a project (including delegated)
bd list --project=proj-123 --include-delegated

# Agent's full history
bd audit --actor=greenplace/crew/joe
```

## Dolt Federation Configuration

### Current Setup

Town-level Dolt databases have remotes configured pointing to DoltHub:

```bash
# Check configured remotes for town database
cd ~/gt/.dolt-data/town && dolt remote -v
# origin https://doltremoteapi.dolthub.com/steveyegge/gastown-town {}
# local  http://localhost:8000/town {}
```

### Configured Remotes

| Database | Remote Name | URL | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|-----|---------|
| town | origin | `steveyegge/gastown-town` | DoltHub public federation |
| town | local | `http://localhost:8000/town` | Local development/testing |
| gastown | origin | `steveyegge/gastown-rig` | DoltHub public federation |
| beads | origin | `steveyegge/gastown-beads` | DoltHub public federation |

### Federation Endpoint Options

**1. DoltHub (Recommended for Public Federation)**

Like GitHub for Dolt - public, hosted, zero infrastructure:

```bash
# Login to DoltHub (one-time setup)
dolt login

# Push to remote
cd ~/gt/.dolt-data/town
dolt push origin main
```

**2. Local Remotesapi (Development/Testing)**

Already enabled in `~/gt/.dolt-data/config.yaml`:
- Port: 8000
- Mode: read-only (set `read_only: false` for full federation)

```bash
# Test local remote
dolt push local main
```

**3. Self-Hosted DoltLab (Enterprise)**

For private federation within an organization:
- Deploy DoltLab instance
- Configure remote: `dolt remote add corp https://doltlab.corp.example.com/org/repo`

**4. Direct Town-to-Town (Advanced)**

Two Gas Town instances federating directly:
- Town A runs remotesapi on accessible endpoint
- Town B adds Town A as remote: `dolt remote add town-a http://town-a.example.com:8000/town`

### Enabling Full Federation

To push/pull from configured remotes:

1. **DoltHub Authentication:**
   ```bash
   dolt login
   # Opens browser for OAuth
   # Creates credentials in ~/.dolt/creds/
   ```

2. **Create DoltHub Repository:**
   - Visit https://www.dolthub.com
   - Create repository matching remote name (e.g., `steveyegge/gastown-town`)

3. **Initial Push:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/gt/.dolt-data/town
   dolt push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Enable Write for Local Remotesapi:**
   Edit `~/gt/.dolt-data/config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   remotesapi:
     port: 8000
     read_only: false  # Enable writes
   ```
   Restart daemon: `gt down && gt up`

### Security Considerations

- **DoltHub**: Public by default; use private repos for sensitive data
- **Local remotesapi**: Bind to localhost only; use TLS for network access
- **Authentication**: DoltHub uses OAuth; self-hosted can use TLS client certs

## Use Cases

### Multi-Repo Projects

Track work spanning multiple repositories:

```
Project X
├── hop://team/frontend/fe-123
├── hop://team/backend/be-456
└── hop://team/infra/inf-789
```

### Distributed Teams

Team members in different workspaces:

```
Alice's Town → works on → Project X
Bob's Town   → works on → Project X
```

Each maintains their own CV/audit trail.

### Contractor Coordination

Prime contractor delegates to subcontractors:

```
Acme/Project
└── delegates to → Vendor/SubProject
                   └── delegates to → Contractor/Task
```

Completion cascades up. Attribution preserved.

## Design Principles

1. **Flat namespace** - Entities not nested, relationships connect them
2. **Relationships over hierarchy** - Graph structure, not tree
3. **Git-native** - Federation uses git mechanics (remotes, refs)
4. **Incremental** - Works standalone, gains power with federation
5. **Privacy-preserving** - Each entity controls their chain visibility

## Enterprise Benefits

| Challenge | Without Federation | With Federation |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Cross-repo dependencies | "Check with backend team" | Explicit dependency tracking |
| Contractor visibility | Email updates, status calls | Live status, same tooling |
| Release coordination | Spreadsheets, Slack threads | Unified timeline view |
| Agent attribution | Per-repo, fragmented | Cross-workspace CV |
| Compliance audit | Stitch together logs | Query across workspaces |

Federation isn't just about connecting repos - it's about treating distributed
engineering as a first-class concern, with the same visibility and tooling
you'd expect from a monorepo, while preserving team autonomy.
